Programming Languages: C++, Java, Python, R, Matlab

Majors/Concentrations: CS in ML/Data Analytics and Applied Mathematics

Most Experience: Most of my experience comes from classes and research projects. An example project is Time Series Forecasting of Energy Expenditure.

Largest System: I don't think I've really done a system. The largest project I worked on was a no game engine RPG in C++ which still wasn't that large.

Most Comfortable: I feel most comfortable doing algorithms and backend code, specifically analytics and machine learning are my strongest.

Least Comfortable: I don't think I'm too diverse of a programmer currently, so I would say front end isn't great. I also haven't made API's before so that would be weak.
